### 1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Throughout the course, I focused on input validation and unit testing to ensure functionality and catch errors early. These practices helped me build reliable components and handle unexpected input. In the future, I would enhance security by implementing regular dependency checks, encrypting sensitive data, and applying the principle of least privilege to limit access and reduce risk.

### 2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User constraints and requirements offered a complete perspective on the problem. This helped me identify what features were necessary and how users would interact with them. I could then focus on features meeting those requirements, developing with the user in mind.

### 3. How do I approach designing software?
Separating my conditional statements into functions enhanced code clarity, preventing lengthy chains of if statements. A caveat is that it complicates code coverage, since branching logic is now spread across multiple functions. Still, it made the structure more readable and easier to manage as the project scaled.
